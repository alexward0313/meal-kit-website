# meal-kit-website
This is a website that I worked on for a school I attended, they wanted to have a Meal Kit program and asked me to build a website where people can go and see the options that the school provided

DISCLAIMER: The school year ended before the entire Meal Kit Project could be completed, I did my part but I was unable to acquire proper photos or descriptions of all the meals the school would provide. This is what I completed and what I turned in to the district, I am unaware of what they are currently doing with this project.
